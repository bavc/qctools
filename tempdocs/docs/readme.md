# Documentation for QCTools Documentation

Hello! Welcome to the QCTools documentation.

The primary document exists in qctools.md.

There is also a Makefile in this directory. Running this Makefile on your local machine will turn qctools.md into qctools.html and qctools.pdf.

To run a Makefile on a Mac, navigate your Terminal to this Docs folder. If you are in the main qctools repository, you will have to type `cd Docs`. After that, type `make` and press enter.

If the qctools.pdf does not get created, there may be some dependencies that need to be installed on your machine.
