            As an additional permission to the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1, the object code form of a "work that uses the Library" may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.

            3. You do not have to provide a copy of the Qwt license with programs that are linked to the Qwt library, nor do you have to identify the Qwt license in your program or documentation as required by section 6 of the LGPL.
