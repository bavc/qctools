        <p>By clicking the filter checkboxes you can select those that you wish to analyze and display. You may make these selections before uploading your video or at any time after the QC Tools analysis has been done and the graph display will update dynamically.

        For descriptions of each Filter and how to read graph values, please see the Help Section, denoted by the '?' icon in the toolbox portion of the application.</p>

        <p>Scrubbing your keyboard cursor over the graph will cause the thumbnails to update to show the images that correspond to the associated graph.</p>
