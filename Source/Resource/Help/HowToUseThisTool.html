        <h2>Load Video Files</h2>

            </ol>
        <h2>Select Filters</h2>
        By clicking the filter box you can select those that you wish to analyze and display. You may make these selections before uploading your video or at any time after the QC Tools analysis has been done and the graph display will update dynamically.
        As a default, 'Y values', 'U values', 'V values', and 'Diffs' are selected.
