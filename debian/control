Description: QCTools
 .
 QCTools (Quality Control Tools for Video Preservation) is a free and open source software tool
 that helps users analyze and understand their digitized video files through use of audiovisual analytics and filtering
 to help users detect corruptions or compromises in the results of analog video digitization or in born-digital video.
 The goal of the project is to cut down the time it takes to perform high-quality video preservation
 and direct time towards preservation issues that are solvable - for example, identifying tapes
 that would benefit from a second transfer, saving not only the precious time of preservationists
 and institutional resources, but giving collections a necessary advantage in the bigger race against time
 to preserve their significant cultural artifacts. QCTools incorporates archival standards and best practices
 for reformatting and capturing metadata that enables the long-term preservation of and access to the original artifact,
 the digital object, and the associated catalog record.
